   ```
                         
4. **Prepare the flask app to run and run it**
   ```

### API documentation
#### Restrictions 
The API has next restrictions (imposed by CORS):
- only resources matching `/api/*` can be reached and it can be done by all origins
- only GET, POST, DELETE, and OPTIONS HTTP methods are allowed

#### Endpoint conventions and Error codes
All responses are returned in JSON format and all contain a 
"success" key, which will return either True or False.

The API can return next error codes: 400, 404, 405, 422, and 500. 
The return format has the following structure (example for the 404 code): 
```
{
    "success": False,
    "error": 404,
    "message": "resource not found"
}
```
#### API Objects
The API has two types of objects, Categories and Questions.
1. Categories
   
   Category is a category of a question. It can have one of 6 possible values: 
Science, Art, Geography, History, Entertainment, and Sports

   Each Question contains a question itself, a category it belongs to, 
a difficulty (on a scale of 1 to 6), and an answer.
